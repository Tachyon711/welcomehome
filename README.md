# Welcome Home!
Say hello to Welcome Home! v.1.1.5

This project is built to provide a custom, light, and minimal new tab page for browsers, particularly Chromium-based ones.
It would also work with other browsers that support Chrome extensions, like Firefox and Waterfox.

I built this project to substitute for other existing alternatives. As to why:
- I don't want my new tab page to start connections to load resources. 
- I don't want my new tab page to be heavily decorated.
- Microsoft Edge and Duckduckgo start page is slow, for me.
- A new tab page should be functional, aesthetically pleasing, and light.

## Features
- Date
- Simple clock
- Simple bookmarks list
- Dark mode by default. See light mode below.

## Others
- Human-readable code.
- Only 25 KB. That's all.
- Unpacked. Easily modifiable. Or maybe I'm lazy to pack it.
- Around 15-25 MB memory usage.
- With minimalism in mind, design, and code.
- Only deals with the new tab page. Just that.
- Uses only the local storage to load resources. No CDN, no Google Fonts.

## Instruction
1. Extract the files in an empty folder.
2. Find your browser's extension settings.
    i. If you're in Chrome/Chromium, go to chrome://extensions
    ii. If you're in Edge, go to edge://extensions
3. Activate the developer mode in the upper right corner.
4. Click load unpacked in the upper left.
5. Select the folder where you extracted the files.
6. The browser loads the extension, and you're done.

### How to activate light mode:
1. Locate "lightmode.css"
2. Rename index.css to "dark.css"
3. Rename lightmode.css to "index.css"
4. Reload new tab.

To make changes, open "index.html" or "index.css" using Notepad.
