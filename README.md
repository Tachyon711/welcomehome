# Welcome Home

> [!WARNING]
> This extension is unpacked and does not follow the usual installation process. Read the [instructions](https://github.com/Tachyon711/welcomehome#instruction) first.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to proceed with a packed copy, download [here](https://github.com/Tachyon711/welcomehome/raw/main/Welcome%20Home.crx). Simply drag and drop in the extension settings. No need to do the instructions below. However, some browsers might block this, and you won't be able to easily edit the code.

**Say hello to Welcome Home!**

This project is built to provide a custom, light, and minimal new tab page extension for browsers, particularly Chromium-based ones.
It would also work with other browsers that support Chrome extensions, like Firefox and Waterfox.

I built this project to substitute for other existing alternatives. As to why:
- I don't want my new tab page to start connections to load resources. 
- I don't want my new tab page to be heavily decorated.
- Microsoft Edge and Duckduckgo start page is slow, for me.
- A new tab page should be functional, aesthetically pleasing, and light.

## Features
- Date
- Simple clock
- Simple bookmarks list
- Dark mode by default. See light mode below.

## Others
- Human-readable code.
- Only 25 KB. That's all.
- Around 15-25 MB memory usage.
- Does not make any connections anywhere.
- With minimalism in mind, design, and code.
- Only deals with the new tab page. Just that.
- Does not collect any data. It just really can't.
- Uses only the local storage to load resources. No CDN, no Google Fonts.

## Instruction

1. Extract the files in an empty folder.
2. Find your browser's extension settings.
     - If you're in Chrome/Chromium, go to chrome://extensions
     - If you're in Edge, go to edge://extensions
3. Activate the developer mode in the upper right corner.
4. Click load unpacked in the upper left.
5. Select the folder where you extracted the files.
6. The browser loads the extension, and you're done.

### How to activate light mode:
1. Locate "lightmode.css"
2. Rename index.css to "dark.css"
3. Rename lightmode.css to "index.css"
4. Reload new tab.

To make changes, open "index.html" or "index.css" using Notepad.
